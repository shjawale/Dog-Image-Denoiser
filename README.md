# Dog-Image-Denoiser

In this assignment, I made a linear and nonlinear dog image denoiser. I used PyTorch, UNet for image segmentation, and matplotlib for visualization. It was completed on Google Colab only since it requires a lot of virtualization my local Linux machine could not handle.

The Validator Means Squared Error for denoising using linear model was 0.0026
The Validator Means Squared Error for denoising using UNet was 0.0097
